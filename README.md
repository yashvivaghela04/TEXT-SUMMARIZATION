# TEXT-SUMMARIZATION
An interactive web page for generating concise text summaries using Hugging Face's BART model. Users can input text, adjust the summary length, and access features like copying, downloading, or saving drafts. This interface is built with HTML, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Flask to handle the backend API requests.
